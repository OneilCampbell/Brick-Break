# Brick-Break-Game

[Play The Game](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/OneilCampbell/Brick-Break-Game)

A remake of the classic Brick Break Game! While learning about the HTML Canvas element for the first time, I decided to simultaneously learn how to build 2D games on it. Using the MDN tutorial on the canvas as guidance I built this game in stages:

- First I learned how to create the Canvas and draw shapes on it.
- Next I figured out how to get the objects I drew to move around on the canvas, as well as how to control that movement using the arrow keys and event listeners.
- After accomplishing manual control over the objects, the next step was to employ collision detection and subsequently removing objects from the Canvas.
- Lastly, came the fine tuning. Adding a displayed score as well as the number of remaining lives the player has, that both get updated appropriately, naturally led to the need for a win and lose state.

Building this game out naturally came with its challenges and roadblocks given that I was learning two things at once. However, it was an enjoyable experience that resulted in my first ever game.
